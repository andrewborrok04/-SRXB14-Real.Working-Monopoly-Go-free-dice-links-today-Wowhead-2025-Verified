Monopoly Go Dice Link not working for you?
Have you just tried claiming a Monopoly Go Dice Link and it didn't work? Dice links can only be redeemed once per Monopoly Go account, so if you click on a link and get a message that says "This reward has already been claimed" then that means you've redeemed it previously. If you get a message that says "This reward cannot be claimed" then that means one of two things. This error message appears when a link has expired, or when a link has just been released - and you need to close and re-open your Monopoly Go app to get it working. Keep checking back here, we are constantly updating this page with the latest links, and removing links when they stop working.

If you click on a dice link and it doesn't even open in Monopoly Go then that's a different issue. From our experience, there can sometimes be teething troubles when you try to open a dice link on an Android device. When you click on a link in your browser, you should get a pop-up menu asking you to 'open in another app'.

If this doesn't happen, and the link instead opens up a separate tab on your browser and doesn't redeem, try refreshing that page and see if the pop-up menu appears. You can also try clicking on the link again and see if that triggers the menu. If none of these troubleshooting tips work, try closing and then re-opening the Monopoly Go app so it's running in the background. Then, head back here and try clicking on the link again to see if that kicks things into gear.
